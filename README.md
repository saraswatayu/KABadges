## Dependencies

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is the preferred IDE. This project is written in Swift 2, which requires Xcode 7.
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) manages Fabric's integration with this application. Install this via `gem install cocoapods`. It is recommended that you use a version of Ruby other than the one included with your system (if you're using a Mac). [`rbenv`](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) is a popular Ruby version manager. You might need to precede this command (and the following one) with `sudo` if you decide to use the system-bundled version of Ruby.
- An [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com): you will need one of these in order to deploy to an iOS device. Xcode 7 will allow you to deploy to a device without an [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) membership.
